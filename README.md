## Description
This is a receptionist skill for the computer science department which has been developed to handle basic functions.

Developed a conversational receptionist skill for the Furhat social robot using Kotlin and the Furhat SDK.
Designed a Natural Language Understanding component: defined intents (e.g., ask-staff, ask-course, ask-room) and entities to accurately parse user queries and trigger relevant responses.
Integrated knowledge sources (e.g., staff profiles, course catalog, building layout) to dynamically fetch and relay accurate information at runtime.
Implemented multi-turn dialogues to engage users in natural help flows, including greetings, follow-up questions, clarification prompts, and closure.
Conducted usability sessions to refine interaction flow, pacing, and phrasingâ€”elevating trust in human-robot communication through iterative design.
